Note that a song, in our app, has ONE artist associated with it. \r\n\r\n- *SongList*: The responsibility for this class is to store and manage ALL the songs entered by the user via the console.\r\n\r\n- *Driver*: The responsibility for this class is to manage the User Interface (UI) i.e. the menu and user input/ouput.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe instructions for developing the app and the above classes are on the following tabs. \r\n\r\n\r\n##Some key points to remember when coding your assignment\r\n\r\n- You **must** use the names given for the Classes and Methods; failure to do so will result in reduced marks.\r\n\r\n- For all variables, methods and classes used, please adhere to the naming standards discussed in class.\r\n\r\n- Use internal, helper methods (i.e. private access methods) where appropriate.  The interface for your class **must** match the interface given in the assignment brief.  Deviating from the interface will result in reduced marks.  Note: the interface here refers to the fields, constructors and methods that are visible outside the class. \r\n\r\n- Your classes and methods should be Javadoc commented.\r\n\r\n- Don't forget that you can get IntelliJ to generate methods such as getters, setters, constructors and toString.  It is a good idea to generate these methods and then add the additional requirements (such as validation) manually.  This will free up some time for concentrating on other areas of the assignment. \r\n\r\n- There should be absolutely *NO* **System.out.println** or **Scanner** reads in any class except for Driver.  If you have any such interaction with the user in any class other than Driver, you will loose marks.  Instead, you should be returning information back to Driver to print it.  Or passing information read in Driver to other classes via method parameters.\r\n\r\n\r\n"

The *runMenu* method is the one that contains the switch statement that processes the user choice.  \r\n\r\n##Option 1 - Add an Artist\r\n\r\nCreate an *addArtist()* method in Driver.  This method asks the user to enter the artist name, email and phone number.  The entered Artist is then stored in the ArrayList of Artists (i.e. in the ArtistList class). \r\n\r\n![](img/option1.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n##Option 2 - List all Artists\r\n\r\nCalls the *listOfArtists* method in the *artistList* class.

It then calls the *listSongsBySpecificGenre* method in the SongList class and prints the returned String to the console.\r\n\r\n![](img/option6.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n##Option 7 - List all songs by artist\r\n\r\nCreate a *listSongByArtist()* method in Driver.  The method should ask the user to enter the name of the artist to search by.  It then calls the *listSongsBySpecificArtist* method in the SongList class and prints the returned String to the console.\r\n\r\nNote: partial names should return results i.e. *Joh* should return *John Flynn* and *Johanna*. \r\n\r\n![](img/option7.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n##Option 8 - List song statistics\r\n\r\nCreate a *listSongStats()* method in Driver.  \r\n\r\nThis method should print out the average song length and the length of all songs (these methods are written in the SongList class).  The output should be converted from seconds to be of the format (mm:ss).  \r\n\r\nFinally, the details of the longest song should be displayed. \r\n\r\n![](img/option8.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n##Option 9 - Remove a song (by index)\r\n\r\nCreate a *deleteSong()* method in Driver.  This method lists all the songs (hint: we used this method in option 5).  If there are:\r\n\r\n- songs in the list, ask the user to enter the index number of the song to delete.  Then, provided that the index number is valid, the Song is deleted from the list. \r\n\r\n- no songs in the list, the following message is displayed:  There is no song for this index number.\r\n\r\n![](img/option9.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n##Option 10 - Save to XML\r\n\r\nThis method will save both lists (the artists and the songs) to an XML file. \r\n\r\n\r\n##Option 11 - Load from XML\r\n\r\nThis method will load both lists (the artists and the songs) form the XML file that was created in Option 10. \r\n\r\n\r\n##Option 0 - Exit\r\n\r\nThis option exits the application.  \r\n\r\n"

HOWEVER, IT WILL HELP YOU IDENTIFY AND FIX BUGS IN YOUR CODE, THEREBY INCREASING YOUR GRADE.**\r\n\r\nFor correcting your assignments, we have written four automated test classes:\r\n\r\n- *SongTest*: This class exhaustively tests the methods in the Song class. \r\n- *ArtistTest*: This class exhaustively tests the methods in the Artist class. \r\n- *SongListTest*: This class tests all methods, except load and store in the SongList class. \r\n- *ArtistListTest*: This class tests all methods, except load and store in the ArtistList class\r\n\r\nWe will be running these classes over your submitted assignment and correcting based on the results of the tests.  We are releasing them to you so that, prior to submitting your work, you can pre-correct your assignment and make changes / fix your code based on the output of the tests.\r\n\r\nThe following steps will show you how to incorporate these into your assignment.\r\n\r\n\r\n##Creating a Test Folder\r\n\r\nIn your IntelliJ project, right click on your project name.  When the context menu appears, select *New --> Directory*.  Call the new directory *test*.  \r\n\r\nNote that the *src* folder is blue in colour and the *test* one is grey:\r\n\r\n![](img/14.png)\r\n\r\nWe need to 'mark' this directory as a test source folder.  To do this, right click on the new *test* folder and when the context menu appears, select *Mark Directory as --> Test Sources Root*: \r\n\r\n![](img/15.png)\r\n\r\nYour *test* directory should now be green in colour.\r\n\r\n\r\n##Creating a test class\r\n\r\nRight click on the *test* folder and choose *New --> Java Class*.  Give the class the name, *SongTest*.  \r\n\r\nDelete any generated code in your new class and paste [this code](archives/SongTest.java) into it instead.\r\n\r\nYou will notice that a lot of errors exist in relation to the *JUnit* imports *annotations* and the *assert* methods:\r\n\r\n![](img/16.png)\r\n\r\nWe need to add JUnit to our classpath so that these imports and methods can be recognised.

In our case here, all our tests passed:\r\n\r\n![](img/18.png)\r\n\r\nIf you have failing tests, the output could look something like this:\r\n\r\n![](img/19.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n##Fixing Errors\r\n\r\nIf your test class is not compiling i.e. has syntax errors, resist the urge to change the code in the test class.  Instead return to your classes and update your code.  Typical things that could be wrong in your code include:\r\n\r\n- class name different (check case sensitivity)\r\n- method names different (check case sensitivity)\r\n- missing methods in your code\r\n- wrong return types in your methods\r\n- etc....\r\n\r\nIf your test class is compiling but is failing on tests, maybe there is an issue with:\r\n\r\n- validation e.g.:\r\n    - validation not included as speced\r\n    - validation only done at constructor level\r\n    - only the *if* part is included (no else)\r\n    - maybe you are checking different values to the test class e.g. > 0 instead of >= 0\r\n    - etc.\r\n\r\n- requirements missed e.g.\r\n    - maybe you forgot to include all the requirements for a specific method e.g. in the list methods, you typically should have three return statements...maybe you don't have them all included.\r\n\r\n- general bugs e.g.\r\n    - maybe you are updating the wrong field by accident\r\n    - maybe you are forgetting to update something\r\n    - so many different things can go wrong here!\r\n\r\nAs you make changes to your code, keep running the tests to see your progress.  \r\n\r\n\r\n##Remaining test classes\r\n\r\nFollow the same procedure as above to include the following three test classes:\r\n\r\n- [ArtistTest.java](archives/ArtistTest.java).\r\n- [SongListTest.java](archives/SongListTest.java).\r\n- [ArtistListTest.java](archives/ArtistListTest.java).\r\n\r\nNote: there is no automated test class for Driver.java as this one uses the console for input (i.e. keeps *interrupting* the program running).\r\n\r\n"

    "contentMd" : "#Submitting your assignment\r\n\r\nWhen you are ready to submit your assignment:\r\n\r\n- Rename your project folder using the naming convention **firstname_surname** e.g. siobhan_drohan.\r\n\r\n- Zip this folder ensuring that it is called  **firstname_surname.zip**.  No WINRARs please!\r\n\r\n- The deadline for this assignment is **10 pm Friday 8th March, 2019**.\r\n\r\n\r\n##Interviews\r\n\r\nAs you know, it is **compulsory** that you are interviewed on your submission in order to demonstrate both *Understanding* and *Authorship*.  \r\n\r\nThese interviews will typically take place in labs the week after submission.  \r\n\r\nThe grade for the interview is a multiplier for your assigment grade.  Should you fail to show for your interview, you will receive zero, resulting in an overall grade of zero for your submission.\r\n\r\n\r\n"

    "contentMd" : "#Indicative Marking Scheme\r\n\r\nThe marking scheme for the assignment is broken into the following:\r\n\r\n- Artist Class - 8%\r\n\r\n- Song Class - 7%\r\n\r\n- ArtistList Class - 15%\r\n\r\n- SongList Class - 35%\r\n\r\n- Driver - 25%\r\n\r\n- Javadoc - 5%\r\n\r\n- Coding standards, naming, style, etc - 5%\r\n\r\nThe above totals to 100%.\r\n\r\n\r\n##Extra Credit \r\n\r\nExtras - 10% will be available to include extras like including exceptions throughout, robust error handling, etc. This 10% is only available if all other functionalities are attempted and will bring your mark to a maximum of 100%.  Good examples of extra credit functionality could be:\r\n\r\n- to do a cascade delete on the Artist i.e. delete all the songs associated with the artist.  If attempting this, you might need to do a bit of research on the .equals() method.  \r\n    \r\n- when adding an Artist to a Song, you might have noticed that you had to select an Artist from a list of pre-existing artists.  There was no option to allow the user to add a new Artist.  Instead, what you could do is allow the user to enter, say, -1 to add a new Artist.  \r\n\r\nNote: If you are making changes to the functionality, it may be the case that the tests will fail for that particular area.  In this case, you are permitted to update the tests to reflect this new functionality, but please include a README with your project to indicate that you have done this. \r\n\r\n\r\n##Interviews\r\n\r\nThe grade for the interview is a multiplier for your assigment grade.  Should you fail to show for your interview, you will receive zero, resulting in an overall grade of zero for your submission.\r\n\r\n\r\n##Use of JUnit when developing your code\r\n\r\nIf your code passes the JUnit tests provided, this means that you will automatically have 65% (interview permitting!).\r\n\r\nUse of the JUnit tests will significantly help you to improve your code. It is worth the effort of getting it up and running and will also be a help to you when we cover it more fully later in the semester. Go for it!\r\n\r\n"
