    "contentMd" : "#The Repeat Assignment\r\n\r\nThe repeat assignment is an enhanced version of Assignment 2 that you worked on earlier this semester.  In particular, you are being asked to complete Assignment 2 and also add validation on the fields in some model classes.\r\n\r\nYou are permitted to use the code that you have already written for Assignment 2 and build on it.  You don't need to revisit the assignment 2 specification again as all details are included here in this specification.\r\n\r\n\r\n##Background of the System\r\n\r\nThe Medical Council of Ireland maintains a database of doctors practicing in the country.  Your task is to develop a scaled-down version of their database of doctors.  The menu-driven, console app will be able to handle three types of doctor registration:\r\n\r\n- Intern\r\n- General  \r\n- Specialist \r\n\r\nFor each type of doctor, you can add multiple qualifications and for specialists, you can add multiple areas of speciality.\r\n\r\nThe information entered via the app will be persisted in an XML file.\r\n\r\nA suggested menu is:\r\n\r\n![](img/menu.png)\r\n\r\nA suggested file structure is:\r\n\r\n![](img/files.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n##Similar(ish) Projects\r\n\r\nIn your previous labs, you worked on a Shop project and saw an inheritance hierarchy in the Social Network project.  \r\n\r\nYour assignment will incorporate some concepts from these projects but will require you to develop your own algorithms to solve some of the requirements given to you.\r\n\r\nThe solution to the Shop V5.0 project can be found [here](archives/ShopV5.0.zip).\r\n\r\nThe solution to the Social Network V4.0 project can be found [here](archives/network-solution-v4.zip).\r\n\r\n\r\n##utils\r\n\r\nWe recommend using *ScannerUtility* (see the Shop project above) for all int and double input.  This will ensure a robust application for numeric data entry.  Consider also writing two additional methods in this utility class to read a line and also read a char.  That way, all of your scanner reads are in one location.\r\n\r\n\r\n##Some key points to remember when coding your assignment\r\n\r\n- You **must** use the names given for the Classes and Methods; failure to do so will result in reduced marks.\r\n\r\n- For all variables, methods and classes used, please adhere to the naming standards discussed in class.\r\n\r\n- Use internal, helper methods (i.e. private access methods) where appropriate.  The interface for your class **must** match the interface given in the assignment brief.  Deviating from the interface will result in reduced marks.  Note: the interface here refers to the fields, constructors and methods that are visible outside the class. \r\n\r\n- Your classes and methods should be Javadoc commented.\r\n\r\n- Don't forget that you can get IntelliJ to generate methods such as getters, setters, constructors and toString.  It is a good idea to generate these methods and then add the additional requirements (such as validation) manually.  This will free up some time for concentrating on other areas of the assignment. \r\n\r\n- There should be absolutely *NO* **System.out.println** or **Scanner** reads in any class except for Driver (and utility classes, if you are using them).  If you have any such interaction with the user in any class other than Driver, you will loose marks.  Instead, you should be returning information back to Driver to print it.  Or passing information read in Driver to other classes via method parameters.\r\n\r\n"

    "contentMd" : "#Doctor hierarchy\r\n\r\n![](img/01.png)\r\n\r\nThe classes in the **Doctor** hierarchy are each described below.  Note:\r\n\r\n- Use IntelliJ to generate, where applicable, *constructors*, *accessors* and *mutators* methods. \r\n\r\n- The toString method should return the current object state as well as the object state in any of its super classes.  \r\n\r\n\r\n##Doctor\r\n\r\nAn abstract class that manages common information for a doctor, along with their qualifications.  This is the super class of the Doctor hierarchy and also implements the *iDoctor* interface (see below for details on this interface).\r\n\r\n![](img/02.png)\r\n\r\nThe validation that you should include in this class is as follows:\r\n\r\n- **name** - should be between 10 and 30 characters inclusive\r\n- **address** - should be between 10 and 100 characters inclusive\r\n- **contactNumber** - should contain only numbers\r\n\r\nThe getFullGender method is a helper method that returns *Female* if an *F* is stored, *Male* if an *M* is stored and *Unknown* otherwise.  This method is invoked in the Doctor's toString method.\r\n\r\n\r\n##iDoctor\r\n\r\nAn *Interface* that is implemented by the *Doctor* class and has the following method signatures:\r\n\r\n~~~java\r\n    double calcRegistrationFee();\r\n    String viewContactDetails();\r\n~~~\r\n\r\nThe viewContactDetails() method is implemented directly in the Doctor class.  This method returns a snapshot of details relating to the doctor (i.e. just the name, address and contact number).\r\n\r\nThe calcRegistrationFee() method is implemented in all of the *concrete* classes below.  \r\n\r\n\r\n##RegisteredDoctor\r\n\r\nAn abstract class that manages whether the doctor was qualified in Ireland or not.  This extends the Doctor class.\r\n\r\n![](img/03.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n##General\r\n\r\nA concrete class that stores no additional data but calculates the annual fee owed to the medical council for a regular doctor.  The fee is 194 if they were qualified in Ireland and 410 otherwise. This class extends RegisteredDoctor.\r\n\r\n![](img/04.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n##Specialist\r\n\r\nA concrete class that stores a HashSet of specialisms and calculates the annual fee owed to the medical council.  For a specialist, the fee is 425 if they were qualified in Ireland and 641 otherwise. This class extends RegisteredDoctor.  The viewContactDetails should be overridden here and, in conjuction with the name, address and contactNumber, the specialisms should be returned.  \r\n\r\n![](img/06.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n##Intern\r\nA concrete class that stores no additional data but determines the annual fee (flat fee of 310) owed to the medical council for an intern.  Note in the diagram above, that the intern doesn't extend *RegisteredDoctor* as they are still officially in training. \r\n\r\n![](img/05.png)\r\n\r\n"

If none of these are entered, give a default value of *XXX*.\r\n\r\n- **degreeName** - should be between 5 and 100 characters inclusive\r\n\r\n- **college** - should be between 5 and 80 characters inclusive\r\n\r\n- **conferringYear** - should contain only numbers and should be greater than 1940.

Note that there are no System.out.println statements in this class, nor are there any Scanner reads; all the I/O is in the other controller class, the *Driver* (and the utility classes, if you are using them).\r\n\r\n![](img/08.png)\r\n\r\nAlso note that the methods listed below are only some of the methods that you will probably require to complete the assignment.  The methods that you will add to this class will depend on the menu items that you include in the Driver class.  \r\n\r\n\r\n##Fields\r\n\r\nThere is one private field, *doctors*, which is an ArrayList of Doctor.  It should be instantiated at declaration time.  \r\n\r\n\r\n##Constructor\r\n\r\nWe will use the default constructor for this class (no need to code it).  For this reason, there is no constructor shown in the diagram above.\r\n\r\n\r\n##Methods (getters and setters)\r\n\r\nThere are no getter or setter methods for the instance field *doctors*.  Instead, we will use the following methods to manage the ArrayList.\r\n\r\n\r\n##Methods (addDoctor)\r\n\r\nThis method will add a Doctor object (passed as a parameter) to the ArrayList *doctors*.  There is no validation in this method.\r\n\r\n\r\n##Methods (getDoctor)\r\n\r\nThis method will return a Doctor object at the location *index*, which is passed as a paramter.  There is some validation in this method:\r\n\r\n- Check that the passed index exists in the ArrayList:\r\n\r\n    - if it does exist, retrieve the associated Doctor object and return it.\r\n\t- if the passed index is not valid, return *null*. \r\n\r\n\r\n##Methods (removeDoctor)\r\n\r\nThis method removes a Doctor object at the location *index*, which is passed as a paramter.  There is some validation in this method:\r\n\r\n- Check that the passed index exists in the ArrayList:\r\n\r\n    - if it does exist, remove it from the ArrayList and return *true*.\r\n    - if the passed index is not valid, return *false*. \r\n\r\n\r\n##Methods (numberOfDoctors)\r\n\r\nThis method returns the number of Doctor objects stored in the ArrayList *doctors*.\r\n\r\n\r\n##Methods (listOfDoctors, no parameter)\r\n\r\nThis method is similar-ish to a toString.  It builds (and returns) a String of all Doctor objects in the ArrayList.  Each object is on a new line.  The beginning of the line has the index number of the object in the ArrayList e.g.\r\n\r\n![](img/10.png)\r\n\r\nIf there are no songs in the ArrayList, the following message should be returned:  **No doctors stored**.\r\n\r\n\r\n##Methods (listOfDoctors, String parameter)\r\n\r\nThis method is used when reporting on doctors by category.  It builds and returns a list of doctors (and their associated index number in the ArrayList) by either *Intern*, *Specialist* or *General*.  Each doctor object should be on a new line.  Sample output would be:\r\n\r\n![](img/11.png)\r\n\r\nIf there are no doctors of the chosen type, return a message stating **No *doctor-type* doctors stored**. \r\n\r\n\r\n##Methods (searchDoctorsByName)\r\n\r\nThis method builds (and returns) an ArrayList of doctors containing all the Doctor objects whose name matches the String entered by the user.  \r\n\r\nNote: cater for case sensitivity in your searches i.e. *Siobhan, SIOBHAN and siobhan* should be considered the same for search purposes. \r\n\r\n\r\n##Methods (calculateAnnualFees)\r\n\r\nThis method adds all the fees for each doctor stored in the doctors ArrayList.\r\n\r\n\r\n##Methods (save)\r\n\r\nThis method saves all Doctor objects from the ArrayList songs to an XML file *doctors.xml*.  You can use the *xstream* component for this (like we did in class) or any approach you wish.\r\n\r\n\r\n##Methods (load)\r\n\r\nThis method loads all saved Doctor objects back into the program (i.e into the ArrayList doctors) from the XML file *doctors.xml*.  You can use the *xstream* component for this (like we did in class) or any approach you wish.\r\n\r\n"

Hint:  use the ShopV5.0 driver as a guide for completing this class.  \r\n\r\n\r\n##Menu\r\n\r\nA suggested menu is:\r\n\r\n![](img/menu.png)\r\n\r\nWhen writing this class, the above menu is just a suggestion.  You may deviate from this menu as you wish.  If you provide more elaborate menu items/reports, you will need to add more methods to the DoctorAPI class; remember, avoid the temptation to make the ArrayList in DoctorAPI public as this would break encapsulation rules.      \r\n\r\nIf you do deviate from the suggested menu, ensure that you still have the following basic elements on the menu:\r\n\r\n- CRUD on the Doctor list\r\n- CRUD on the specialisms HashSet\r\n- reporting and\r\n- persistence\r\n\r\nFor more direction, please refer to the rubric in the indicative marking scheme tab to see how we are grading the Driver class, the DoctorAPI class and the JUnit testing of the DoctorAPI class.  In particular, please note that 100% in this assignment will require you to provide methods in DoctorAPI with associated menu items in Driver beyond what we have outlined in this spec.  These additional methods will also need to be JUnit tested.    \r\n\r\n\r\n##A note on I/O\r\n\r\nAside from the ScannerInput class (if you are using it),  this class should be the only class that has:\r\n\r\n- System.out.print statements\r\n- Scanner objects defined. \r\n\r\n\r\n"
