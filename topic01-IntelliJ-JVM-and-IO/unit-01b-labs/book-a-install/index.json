Click on the Download link...a similar screen will be displayed:\r\n\r\n![](img/31.png)\r\n\r\nTick the radio button to accept their licence agreement.   \r\n\r\nIf you are using windows, your download is likely to be for Windows 64 e.g.:\r\n\r\n- jdk-11.0.1-windows-x64_bin.exe\r\n\r\nOnce the exe file is downloaded, follow the steps to install it on your computer. \r\n\r\nTo check if it is installed ok - you should type in the following command into the command prompt we opened earlier\r\n\r\n~~~\r\njava -version\r\n~~~\r\n\r\nIf your install was successful, you should get something like this:\r\n\r\n~~~\r\nC:\\Users\\Siobhan>java -version\r\njava version \"11.0.1\" 2018-10-16 LTS\r\nJava(TM) SE Runtime Environment 18.9 (build 11.0.1+13-LTS)\r\nJava HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM 18.9 (build 11.0.1+13-LTS, mixed mode)\r\n~~~\r\n\r\nNote: if it isn't displaying the version you just installed, try closing the command prompt, then reopen it and try the command again.  If this doesn't work, it is typically a problem with your environmental variables; you lecturer will be able to help you with this.\r\n\r\n\r\n# Install Java JDK: Mac\r\n\r\nFor the mac, the best way to install is to use Brew. These commands should do:\r\n\r\n~~~\r\nbrew update\r\nbrew install jenv\r\nbrew cask install caskroom/versions/java11\r\n~~~\r\n\r\nGetting the correct java version can be a challenge on mac. \r\n\r\n"
