The app:\r\n\r\n- is a console based system.\r\n\r\n- is a textual dialog system i.e. you enter text on the console and the system will provide a response.\r\n    \r\n- responds with the same String, regardless of the content entered by the user **“That sounds interesting.  Tell me more…”**\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n##Tech Support 2\r\n\r\nCreate a new project in IntelliJ and call it **Tech Support V2**.\r\n\r\nCopy the java files from **Tech Support V1** into **Tech Support V2**.\r\n\r\nMake the necessary changes to this project so that the system provides a random response from a list of pre-defined responses e.g.:\r\n\r\n- \"That sounds interesting. Tell me more...\"\r\n\r\n- \"I need a bit more information on that.\"\r\n\r\n- \"Have you checked that you do not have a dll conflict?\"\r\n\r\n- \"That is explained in the manual. Have you read the manual?“\r\n\r\n- \" That's not a bug, it's a feature!\"\r\n\r\n- \"Could you elaborate on that?“\r\n\r\n- etc.\r\n\r\n\r\nUse your lecture notes to support you in this task.\r\n\r\nTest your completed app to make sure it behaves as expected.\r\n\r\n\r\n"
